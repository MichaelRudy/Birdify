# Birdify iOS Application Coded in SwiftUI

## Overview
This is my attempt at created an iOS application using SwiftUI

## Project Goals
Create a gamified scorecard app that is provides meaningful analytics. However, I want to keep this simple. Most scorecard apps are copies of physical scorecards on your screen. My goal is to create something cleaner. 

I am still getting familiar with SwiftUI. In particular, the declaritive syntax is somewhat hard to get used to.
