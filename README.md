# Birdify iOS Application Coded in SwiftUI

## Overview
This is my first attempt at creating an iOS application using Apple's SwiftUI and Xcode. 

## Project Goals
Create a gamified scorecard app that provides meaningful analytics. However, I want to keep this simple. Most scorecard apps are copies of physical scorecards on your screen. My goal is to design a gamified UX expierence that may include the following:
 * Establish +/- round goals: allows players the ability to actively see their progress towards their set goal (gamified UI/UX)
* Historical round analytics: develop a web application or data store that allows players the ability to see their progression. This may include average shot direction, greens hit in regulation, and number of putts per hole.

    <td><img src="/images/scoreCard.png"  width=270 height=480></td>
